VERB
Each Amazigh verb has four forms (some of them can be same):
- Aorist (the basic form of each verb): used for imperative and future
- Accomplished: used for past
- Negative accomplished: used for negative past
- Unaccomplished: used for continuous imperative/future and the present

To form the tenses with those forms we use affixes:
For imperative:
-ⴰⵜ, -ⴰⵎⵜ (you, plural)
For the rest:
-ⵖ(I), ⵜ-ⵜ(you, sing.), ⵉ-(he/it), ⵜ-(she/it), ⵏ-(we), ⵜ-ⵎ(you, mas., plur.), ⵜ-ⵎⵜ(you, fem., plur.), -ⵏ(they, mas., plur.), -ⵏⵜ(they, fem., plur.)

Examples:
The verb: ⵙⴽⵔ (do)
- Aorist: ⵙⴽⵔ
- Accomplished: ⵙⴽⵔ
- Negative accomplished: ⵙⴽⵉⵔ
- Unaccomplished: ⵙⴽⴰⵔ

- ⵙⴽⵔⵖ (ⵙⴽⵔ + ⵖ) ⵜⴰⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵉⵏⵓ. = I did my work.
- ⵙⴽⵔ ⵜⴰⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵏⵏⴽ! = Do your work!
- ⵔⴰⴷ ⵉⵙⴽⵔ (ⵉ + ⵙⴽⵔ) ⵜⴰⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵏⵏⵙ. = He will do his work.
- ⵓⵔ ⵜⵙⴽⵉⵔⵎ (ⵜ + ⵙⴽⵉⵔ + ⵎ) ⵜⴰⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵏⵏⵓⵏ. = You (plur.) didn't do your work.
- ⴰⵔ ⵜⵙⴽⴰⵔ (ⵜ + ⵙⴽⴰⵔ) ⵜⴰⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵏⵏⵙ. = She is doing her work.
- ⴷⴰ ⵙⴽⴰⵔⵏ (ⵙⴽⴰⵔ + ⵏ) ⵜⴰⵡⵓⵔⵉ ⵏⵏⵙⵏ. = They (mas.) do their work.

The verb: ⵙⵓ (drink)
- Aorist: ⵙⵓ
- Accomplished: ⵙⵡⵉ, ⵙⵡⴰ, (In the case we have two forms for Accomplished, we use the first with [I, singular you] then the second form with the rest)
- Negative accomplished: ⵙⵡⵉ
- Unaccomplished: ⵙⵙⴰ

Example:
- ⵙⵡⵉⵖ (ⵙⵡⵉ + ⵖ) ⴰⵎⴰⵏ. = I drank the water.
- ⵜⵙⵡⵉⵜ (ⵜ + ⵙⵡⵉ + ⵜ) ⴰⵎⴰⵏ. = You drank the water.
- ⵉⵙⵡⴰ (ⵉ + ⵙⵡⴰ) ⴰⵎⴰⵏ. = He drank the water.
- ⵜⵙⵡⴰ (ⵜ + ⵙⵡⴰ) ⴰⵎⴰⵏ. = She drank the water.

Some tenses with marks:
- Future: ⵔⴰⴷ, ⵇⴰⴷ + verb
- Negative past: ⵓⵔ + verb
- Simple present: ⴷⴰ + verb
- Continuous present: ⴰⵔ + verb
- Negative expression in general starts with: ⵓⵔ

•The conjugation of the adjective is similar to the noun (Mas./Fem., Sing./Plur., Free/Constr.).
•The adjective comes after the noun and follows it in the conjugation (Mas -> mas, Fem -> fem, Sing. -> sing., Plur. -> plur.).
•We have to types of Adjectives: the regular adjective, the participle form (uses a verb)

Examples:
- ⵜⴰⵡⵊⵊⴰ ⵜⵓⵎⵍⵉⵍⵜ[ADJ] = The white ball.
